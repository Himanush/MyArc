---------------------> Data Structures and Algorithms <---------------------------

Data Structures can defined as a way to store and organize data so that it can be used efficiently. Data Structures plays an important
role in any software development as they help us to store and retrieve data as fast as possible.

Data Structures can be categorized as Linear and non-linear.
1. A linear data structure is the one in which the elements are arranged in a sequential manner and each element is connected to its previous element and next element.
Linear data Structures are lists that can be
        1. Arrays
        2. Linked list   
        Arrays and linked lists can be used to implement 1. Stack and 2. Queue

2. A non-linear data structure is the one in which the elements are not arranged in sequential manner and each element is connected to other elements through multiple paths.
Non-linear data structures include 
        1. Tree
        2. Graphs
        3. Hash table



1. Array -> Array is a linear data structure used to store similar type of data in a single variable.

Inserting an element in an Array
1. consider array [A,B,C,D,E] 
2. Insert J at third position
3. First, All the elements from the third position to last position are shifted.
4. Then the specific element is inserted at the given position.

CODE - 
class HelloWorld {
    public static void insert(char[] ar, int pos, char value) {

    for(int i=ar.length-1;i>=pos; i--){
            ar[i]=ar[i-1];
        }
        ar[pos-1]=value; 
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        char[] arr = new char [6];
        arr[0]='A';
        arr[1]='B';
        arr[2]='C';
        arr[3]='D';
        arr[4]='E';
        HelloWorld.insert(arr, 3, 'H');
        for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
            System.out.println(arr[i]);
        }
    }
}

Deleting an element from an array
1. consider array [A,B,C,D,E]
2. Delete element at third position
3. For deleting an element from an array, the elements need to be shifted towards the position from which the element has to be deleted.

Limitations of Array:
                    1. An array can contain data of only similar type.Heterogeneous elements cannot be stored in an array.
                    2. Array is of fixed size. Once declared, size cannot be changed.
                    3. Insertion and deletion operations are expensive in terms of memory as they require shifting of elements and might lead to loss of data if we try to exceed the capacity of array.
                    4. The elements of an array are stored in continuous memory locations.If the required number of blocks are not present together in the memory,then the array will not be created.
